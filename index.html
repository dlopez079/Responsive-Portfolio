                    <p>My name is David Lopez.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY.  My parents are from Puerto Rico.  They moved to New York City when I was young.  My father arrived first and moved to the Bronx.  My mother arrived later on and lived in Brooklyn.  </p>
                    <p>My parents raised me in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  It was not a very nice neighborhood.  The school system was not the greatest.  I managed to keep my head in the books and my sports.  Being around school allowed me to stay in sports.</p>
                    <p>I joined a baseball team at 9 years old.  I played baseball my young life and that allowed me to be blind to the negativity around me.</p>
